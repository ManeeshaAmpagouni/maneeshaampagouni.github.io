**Abstract:**
In 1978, mathematician John McKay made a remarkable observation that ignited a series of captivating discoveries and conjectures, revealing unexpected connections between finite group theory and modular forms. This phenomenon, as it unfolded, was dubbed "moonshine" by John H. Conway, capturing the mysterious and intriguing nature of the emerging correspondence. In my talk, I will delve into the journey of exploration spurred by these conjectures. Central to our exploration is the discovery of a structure from physics that serves as a bridge between finite group theory and modular forms. I will elucidate how this unexpected connection sheds light on the mathematical origin of these structures and served as a motivation to study them.
