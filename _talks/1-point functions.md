**Abstract:**
The moonshine module famously links the j-function, a key modular form, to the Monster group, revealing a surprising connection between group theory and modular forms. Zhu’s breakthrough showed that this modular invariance arises from the structure of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) and is associated with specific finiteness properties. This discovery paved the way for recognizing that the moonshine module is not unique in exhibiting modular properties—other VOAs share these traits. Notably, the construction of the moonshine module can be generalized by replacing the Leech lattice with any even lattice, resulting in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of a lattice VOA, which still upholds modular invariance.

In this talk, I will outline the structure of such $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold VOAs, which are formed by joining subspaces of untwisted and twisted sectors of a lattice VOA. Building on the work of Mason and Mertens, who computed the 1-point functions for states in the untwisted sector using methods inspired by Zhu's theory, I will present how I extended these techniques to trace over the twisted sector. This allowed me to derive the 1-point functions for the full $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, highlighting the intricate interplay between VOAs, modular forms, and lattice structures.
