**Abstract:**
A well-known example of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) is the Moonshine module, whose connection to the j-function and the Monster group revealed a surprising link between group theory and modular forms. The construction of the moonshine module can be generalized by replacing the Leech lattice with any even lattice, resulting in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of a lattice VOA, which still exhibits modular invariance. In this talk, I will introduce VOAs and the construction of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of a lattice VOA. The goal of this colloquium is to lay the groundwork for understanding the computation of 1-point functions in such an orbifold, which will be discussed in detail in the algebra and number theory seminar later this week.
