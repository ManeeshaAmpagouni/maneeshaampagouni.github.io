**Abstract:**
The classification of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras is a cornerstone of Lie theory. At the heart of this classification lies the theory of root systems developed through the pioneering work of Wilhelm Killing and Ã‰lie Cartan. In this talk, I will motivate the definition of root systems and introduce Cartan matrices, Cartan integers, Coxeter graphs, and Dynkin diagrams. We will explore the explicit construction of two classical root systems $A_n,D_n$, illustrating the associated Dynkin diagrams.
