I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Mathematics at University of California, Santa Cruz, working under the supervision of [Geoffrey Mason](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/emeriti.php?uid=gem). My current research focuses on the theory of Vertex Operator Algebras.

Beyond mathematics, Iâ€™m passionate about education. I believe in fostering inclusive environments where knowledge can thrive and transcend boundaries. My values are rooted in curiosity, perseverance, and the belief that education is a transformative force that can shape a better future.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy reading and watching animated movies, which offer me a refreshing break. I also love hiking and have explored several trails, appreciating the chance to connect with nature.
